# Project 2

A TCP-based trivia game.

## Project Instructions

In this project you’re designing a multi-player trivia game that will allow players to play this game
over the network. There are different parts in this project as the learning objectives.

- Concurrency control (multi-threading)
- Socket programming TCP
- Socket programming UDP
- GUI and event handling
- Logic development
- Network communication and synchronization
- Network based data structures like Queue

Your development will have two phases and they don’t necessarily need to be developed in a
sequential order: you can develop both in parallel.

### Development Details (Requirements):

To give you all a common client interface you’re being provided with two classes that provide you
with basic GUI and event handling code. You are free to use and modify the code as you deem fit
for your project. The classes are ClientWindow.java and ClientWindowTest.java. The code in these
programs use simple Java Swing elements.

## In-Depth Report

In addition to this README file, we were tasked with creating a detailed project report, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bajackson1/trivia-game/blob/main/REPORT.pdf).
