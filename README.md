## Course Description

This course introduces students to net-centric computing, the web as an example of client-server computing, building internet and web applications, communications and networking, distributed object systems, collaboration technology and groupware, distributed operating systems and distributed systems.

## Tools and Languages Used

For this course we were allowed to use either Java or Python to complete coding assignments. I used Java since we were working in groups and as we learned Java in our classes, most people were more comfortable using it.
